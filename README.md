## Troubleshooting

- If you're not using an emulator, make sure wifi is on and you're connected to the same network.

- Try deleting node_modules and reinstalling:
```sh
rm -rf node_modules && npm install
```

- Turn it off and back on again. Turn off your emulator, unplug your phone, close your terminals, and if that doesn't work, restart your computer.
- Link your libraries automatically by running:
```sh
react-native link
```
